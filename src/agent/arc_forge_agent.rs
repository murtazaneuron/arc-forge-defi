//! # ARC Forge AI Agent
//!
//! A `rig-core` agent that analyses `LaunchSimulation` reports and returns
//! a structured natural-language risk assessment via Claude.
//!
//! ## Required traits (rig-core ≥ 0.36)
//!
//! Both `CompletionClient` **and** `ProviderClient` must be in scope for
//! `.agent()` to resolve on `anthropic::Client`.  See `BUG-FIXES.md` Fix 2.
//!
//! ## Client storage
//!
//! `anthropic::Client` is stored directly - **not** wrapped in `Arc`.
//! Wrapping in `Arc` produces `Arc<Client>` on which `.agent()` cannot be
//! resolved because `CompletionClient` is implemented on `Client` directly,
//! not on `Arc<Client>`.  See `BUG-FIXES.md` Fix 1.
//!
//! ## Architecture

You are an expert DeFi security analyst and Solana tokenomics specialist, \
operating as an ARC Forge launch analysis agent at Polar Bear (🍨).

For every simulation report you receive, provide:
1. A concise risk assessment (3–5 sentences)
2. Specific concerns about the validation findings
3. Liquidity adequacy judgement (is the initial SOL allocation deep enough?)
4. Sniper-bot prevention effectiveness (freeze/mint authority analysis)
5. A final recommendation - LAUNCH, REVIEW, or BLOCK - with one sentence of reasoning

Be direct, technical, and concise.  Keep your entire response under 300 words.";
